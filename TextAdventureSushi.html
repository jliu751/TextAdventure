<hr><br><br>
<p>You both agree on sushi and start to head to the shop.</p>
<br><br>
<p>In Japan, sushi is typically transported on a conveyor belt to the customers fresh out of the kitchen.</p>
<br><br>
<p>And at the end, the plates are totalled up of what you ate, and that is how you pay.</p>

<p>After the meal, you and Haruto are so stuffed that you can barely move.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Haruto says that this is a good place to end the day, and you agree along in unison.</p>
<br><br>
<p>With that being said, you both head your separate ways towards your respective homes.</p>
<br><br>
<p>The End.</p>
